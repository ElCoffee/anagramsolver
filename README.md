# Anagram Solver

Anagram Solver is a small python script to solve for anagrams.
It uses a provided dictionnary, "dict.csv" which I copied ~~manually line by line from the Oxford Dictionnary~~ from someplace I forgot on the internet.

## To-do

- Make a proper installer
- Find a better dictionnary
- Do without Pandas (heavy requirement)
